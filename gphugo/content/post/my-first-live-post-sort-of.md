I would love to say that I have been diligently working on this post for days. In reality, I prototyped the page last night and I'm basically building this site specifically to test a method for quickly building unique static sites. I will be updating the site as I go, and it will have more and prettier functionality soon, but for now, UNDER CONSTRUCTION
