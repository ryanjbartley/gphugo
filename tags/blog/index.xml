I haven&amp;rsquo;t given up on it, but it is extremely stable at the moment and I have another project I&amp;rsquo;m working on.

I don&amp;rsquo;t have a sneak peak that&amp;rsquo;s particularly exciting, but if you want to see it under construction, head over to the storefront project.</description></item><item><title>My first live post!

In reality, I prototyped the page last night and I&amp;rsquo;m basically building this site specifically to test a method for quickly building unique static sites. I will be updating the site as I go, and it will have more and prettier functionality soon, but for now, UNDER CONSTRUCTION</description></item></channel></rss>
