I'm getting to know modern dev tools a bit as I work on this project, and I've found Chrome's built-in dev tools incredibly useful. If you have Chrome, hit F12 sometime and see what it looks like. Don't Panic! You can hit F12 and make it disappear just as easily. But there's a tool in there called lighthouse that helped me cut my site load time down by several seconds. I'm going to continue to work on using the best tools I can get my hands on for free.
