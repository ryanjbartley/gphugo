## **Development Blog**
What you are looking at is, first and foremost, a development blog. 
More than that, it's a personal motivator. I struggle to maintain 
my productivity when a project slows down, so I hope that by
combining the process of development with content creation I am
able to keep this project in my sights when shiny new projects arrive.

## **Free, Self-Deploying Website**
Now, the cool part. This codebase, beyond operating my personal blog,
can be cloned into a new repository in [Github](https://github.com) 
giving you the same site, ready to start developing to suit your needs,
in under 5 minutes. There is work to do after that, if you want to
make sure it's uniquely yours, but that's the fun part of open source,
we are all developers!

## ***Own Your Site Now***
Here's how:
1. Sign up for a github account
> Click on this link to [Sign up for Github](https://github.com/join)  
If you need more help you can check [Github's Help Page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)

2. Fork the project  
(make a copy that you can work on)
> Go to the [gphugo Github](https://www.github.com/ryanjbartley/gphugo) page   
In the upper right hand corner of the github page is a button that you push to `fork` the project  
What this means technically may be a little complex if you're just getting started, but the short version is: when you are done following Github's process to fork the repository, you will have an exact copy of the code that builds the blog, belonging to you, and hosted for free by Github

3. Enable workflows and Github Pages
> Workflows rely on the Github Actions api, which can be enabled on forked repositories by clicking on `Actions` at the top navbar of the repository  
Github pages can be enabled by clicking on `Settings` in the same navbar and scrolling down until you see the subsection labeled `Github Pages`  
You will want to select the `gh-pages` branch and `root` folder

That should have you ready to start coding the site to make it yours. I'll be adding more info about that as I finish the refactor.
